However, I quickly realized that that idea would not work at all. Then I began to think about it by just looking at the next 6 squares, and seeing whether there was any snakes or ladders. |

I began to start thinking about doing something similar to breadth-first-search, but I didn't think that it would apply very well to this scenario. |
| September 3 | 9:30-10:00pm | By this point, I was getting very confused on how to solve this problem, so I started to think about how to find out if the puzzle is unwinnable. This is what I came up with: if there are 6 snakes all in a row, and there is no ladder that skips those snakes (ladder has to start before snakes and end after them), then the puzzle is unwinnable. |
