| September 2 |  1:15-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                              At first, I thought of finding the largest ladders and just taking those. However, I quickly realized that that idea would not work at all. Then I began to think about it by just looking at the next 6 squares, and seeing whether there was any snakes or ladders. |
| September 3 |  9:00-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                            After thinking about iterating over every 6 squares, I got a little stuck on what to do from there. I began to start thinking about doing something similar to breadth-first-search, but I didn't think that it would apply very well to this scenario. |
| September 3 | 9:30-10:00pm  |                                                                                                           By this point, I was getting very confused on how to solve this problem, so I started to think about how to find out if the puzzle is unwinnable. This is what I came up with: if there are 6 snakes all in a row, and there is no ladder that skips those snakes (ladder has to start before snakes and end after them), then the puzzle is unwinnable. |
| September 8 |  9:30-9:55am  | I started working on the project by looking at the pseudocode and translating it into actual code that would run. I ran into a bug while I was trying to create an array/dictionary of all of the snakes and ladders so that I could run the lines of code accessing that information in constant time. This was because I got mixed up with all of the variables and numbers. To fix it, I drew out a sample array of snakes and ladders to help me visualize it. |
| September 8 | 9:30-10:00pm  |                                                                                                               Then, I moved onto the main loop, where I began to think about how I would represent whether a node had been visited or not. I ended up going with another simple array so that it could be accessed in constant time. After finishing that, I had a lot of trouble thinking about tracking how many rolls it took to get to each square's position. |
| September 8 | 10:00-10:45pm |                                                             At first, I thought about adding another row to my main map "skips," but I didn't think that would be very efficient to iterate through. I eventually settled on just making another array where each index stored the number of rolls it took to get there as its value. It took me a bit to finally get the math working with all the roles at the end of the while loop, but after that, it worked! |
